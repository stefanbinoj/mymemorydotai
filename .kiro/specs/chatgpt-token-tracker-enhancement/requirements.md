# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing ChatGPT token tracking extension to provide a more modular architecture with improved developer experience and adds optional Supabase synchronization capabilities. The enhancement will refactor the current token tracking system into independent, abstracted modules while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new sync features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, so that I can easily modify or replace individual components without affecting the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is refactored THEN each core functionality SHALL be separated into independent modules
2. WHEN a module needs to be modified THEN it SHALL NOT require changes to other unrelated modules
3. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL integrate through well-defined interfaces
4. WHEN the token counting logic changes THEN it SHALL NOT affect the UI or storage modules
5. WHEN the storage mechanism changes THEN it SHALL NOT affect the token counting or UI modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the ChatGPT extension, I want to see my token usage displayed at the bottom of the chat interface, so that I can monitor my API consumption in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit ChatGPT THEN the extension SHALL display a token usage widget at the bottom of the page
2. WHEN new messages are sent or received THEN the token count SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN I switch between different chat sessions THEN the token count SHALL reflect the current session's usage
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the widget SHALL show the accumulated token usage for the current session
5. WHEN tokens are counted THEN the display SHALL show both input and output token counts separately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who wants to track my usage across devices, I want an optional sync toggle that saves my chat data to a database, so that I can access my usage history from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the extension popup THEN I SHALL see a sync toggle switch at the top
2. WHEN the sync toggle is enabled THEN my chat data SHALL be automatically saved to Supabase
3. WHEN the sync toggle is disabled THEN data SHALL only be stored locally
4. WHEN sync is enabled THEN token usage data SHALL be synchronized in real-time
5. WHEN sync fails THEN the extension SHALL continue working with local storage only
6. WHEN sync is re-enabled after being offline THEN pending data SHALL be synchronized

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on the extension, I want clear interfaces and dependency injection, so that I can easily test individual components and swap implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN each SHALL have a well-defined interface
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be injected rather than directly imported
3. WHEN testing individual modules THEN they SHALL be testable in isolation
4. WHEN switching from Chrome storage to Supabase THEN it SHALL require minimal code changes
5. WHEN adding new token counting methods THEN existing code SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the extension, I want my data to be handled securely and efficiently, so that my privacy is protected and the extension performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is synced to Supabase THEN it SHALL be transmitted securely over HTTPS
2. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN it SHALL be properly sanitized and validated
3. WHEN the extension runs THEN it SHALL NOT significantly impact ChatGPT's performance
4. WHEN sync is disabled THEN no data SHALL be transmitted to external servers
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without breaking the extension

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any module THEN they SHALL be properly caught and logged
2. WHEN sync operations fail THEN the user SHALL be notified appropriately
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN relevant information SHALL be available in console logs
4. WHEN the extension encounters unexpected states THEN it SHALL recover gracefully
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the extension SHALL continue functioning with local data
