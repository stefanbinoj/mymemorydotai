# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The browser extension is experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) violations when attempting to make direct API calls to Supabase from content scripts or popup contexts. This prevents the extension from properly storing chat message data. The solution involves restructuring the data flow to route all Supabase operations through the background script, which has the necessary permissions to bypass CSP restrictions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a browser extension developer, I want all Supabase API calls to work without CSP violations, so that the extension can reliably store and retrieve chat data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any part of the extension needs to interact with Supabase THEN the request SHALL be routed through the background script
2. WHEN the background script receives a Supabase request THEN it SHALL make the API call using native fetch with proper authentication headers
3. WHEN a Supabase operation completes THEN the background script SHALL return the result to the requesting context
4. IF a Supabase operation fails THEN the background script SHALL return a structured error response with details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content script or popup component, I want a simple API to interact with Supabase, so that I don't need to handle CSP workarounds directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a content script needs to save chat data THEN it SHALL use a unified message passing interface
2. WHEN a popup needs to query chat history THEN it SHALL use the same unified interface
3. WHEN making a Supabase request THEN the interface SHALL handle async responses automatically
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the interface SHALL provide clear error information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want proper error handling and logging for all Supabase operations, so that I can debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Supabase operation is attempted THEN it SHALL be logged with request details
2. WHEN a Supabase operation succeeds THEN it SHALL log the success with response summary
3. WHEN a Supabase operation fails THEN it SHALL log the full error details including status codes
4. WHEN CSP violations occur THEN they SHALL be caught and logged with context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an extension user, I want the extension to handle network failures gracefully, so that temporary connectivity issues don't break the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Supabase request fails due to network issues THEN the extension SHALL retry up to 3 times
2. WHEN all retries are exhausted THEN the extension SHALL cache the data locally for later sync
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the extension SHALL automatically sync cached data
4. WHEN sync operations complete THEN the extension SHALL clear the local cache
