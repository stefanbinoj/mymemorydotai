## 🌟 What Is This?

The **TinkerSpace Badge** is more than a sticker. It’s your proof that you didn’t just talk about building—you actually did it.  
It tells the world you were part of something hands-on, something that matters.

> Projects fade. But when you wear this badge, people know you were _in the room_ where it happened.
